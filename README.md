# How's It Growing?

## Description

An application to help you keep your plant alive and green. You can search for plants and get information for taking care of your plant such as watering, temperature, or amount of shade needed. You can create an account and save your plants to a collection. Saving a plant to a collection will generate more information about that plant such as type, family, and soil fertility.

The following image shows a glimpse of the application:
